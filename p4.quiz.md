30. Scaling an EC2 instance from r4.large to r4.4xlarge is called â€¦
	Vertical Scalability

31. Running an application on an Auto Scaling Group that scales the number of EC2 instances in and out is called ...
	Horizontal Scalability

32. You have an application hosted on a set of EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group that you configured both desired and maximum capacity to 3. Also, ASG is configured to scale out your when CPU Utilization reaches 60%. Your application suddenly received huge traffic and is now running at 80% CPU Utilization. What will happen?
	Nothing

33. You have an Auto Scaling Group fronted by an Application Load Balancer. You have configured the ASG to use ALB Health Checks, then one EC2 instance has been reported unhealthy. What will happen to the EC2 instance?
	The ASG will terminate unhealthy EC2 instance

34. You have a task to scale your ASG based on the number of requests per minute that the application sends to the standalone database. What should you do?
	Create a CloudWatch custom metric then create a CloudWatch alarm on this metric to scale ASG

35. There is an Auto Scaling Configured running in eu-west-2 region, that's configured to spawns two Availability Zones eu-west-2a and eu-west-2b.
