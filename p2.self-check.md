1. What is the difference between IAM identity and IAM principle?
	- Identity: Identities are the IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users, groups, and roles.
	- Entity: IAM entities are the users (IAM users and federated users) and roles that are created and used for authentication
	- Principal: A Principal is a person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS.
A principal can have one or more identities (but only ever one at a time). An identity can have identity policies associated with it.

2. Which type of request to AWS is recorded by CloudTrail?
Every interaction with AWS services ... recorded in CloudTrail even the request was unsuccessful.

3. What's the difference between customer managed IAM policy and AWS managed IAM policy?
	- AWS managed policies – Managed policies that are created and managed by AWS.
	- Customer managed policies – Managed policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Customer managed policies provide more precise control over your policies than AWS managed policies.

4. How does inline policy differ from managed policy?
	- Managed policies – Standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account.
	- Inline policies – Policies that you add directly to a single user, group, or role. Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity. They are deleted when you delete the identity.
An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role). That is, the policy is an inherent part of the identity.
5. What are the limits for inline IAM policy?
We cannot inherit inline policy from one IAM resource to another.
Inline policies are bound to an IAM resource and cannot be used by another. Hence, the scope of inline policy is limited to its IAM resource (roles/group/users).

6. What are the best practices when working with permissions?
	- do not use account root credentials to access AWS resources.
	- employees should have permissions to access only those resources that they need to perform their jobs.
	- employees should have permissions to use only those actions that they need to perform their jobs.
	
7. The AWS CLI credentials and configuration settings take precedence in which order?(name first 3)
	- Command line options – Overrides settings in any other location.
	- Environment variables – You can store values in your system's environment variables.
	- CLI credentials file – The credentials and config file are updated when you run the command aws configure (~/.aws/credentials). This file can contain the credential details for the default profile and any named profiles.
	- CLI configuration file – The credentials and config file are updated when you run the command aws configure (~/.aws/config). This file contains the configuration settings for the default profile and any named profiles.
	- Container credentials – You can associate an IAM role with each of your Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task definitions.
	- Instance profile credentials – You can associate an IAM role with each of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

8. What is the allow/deny priority order when policies are configured on different levels (group, user, etc.)?
An explicit deny in any more specific level overrides the allow.
