# VPC - A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.


#### 
- AWS cloud computing
	- Region - collection of regional datacenters
		- VPC - virtual private cloud
			- Availability zone 1 | Availability zone 2 ...
				- Subnet 1 | Subnet 2 ...
					- Instance 1 | Instance 2 ...



####
- VPC
	- Private subnet
		- security group
			- instance

#### EIPs - Elastic IP Addresses
- You must first allocate an EIP for use within a VPC and then assign it to an instance.
- EIPs are specific to a region (that is, an EIP in one region cannot be assigned to an instance within an Amazon VPC in a different region).
- There is a one-to-one relationship between network interfaces and EIPs.
- You can move EIPs from one instance to another, either in the same Amazon VPC or a different Amazon VPC within the same region.
- EIPs remain associated with your AWS account until you explicitly release them.
- There are charges for EIPs allocated to your account, even when they are not associated with a resource.


#### ENI - An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in an Amazon VPC, They can have one public IP address and multiple private IP addresses.

#### VPC Endpoint
- Interface endpoint
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet.

- Gateway endpoint
These endpoints are only available for S3 and DynamoDB. As the name implies, these endpoints are not deployed as an interface in a subnet, but instead as a route on your route tables.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT) Instances and NAT Gateways
we recommend that you use a NAT gateway instead of a NAT instance

#### VPC Peering
An Amazon VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two Amazon VPCs that enables instances in either Amazon VPC to communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
- You cannot create a peering connection between Amazon VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks.
- Amazon VPC peering connections do not support transitive routing.
- You cannot have more than one peering connection between the same two Amazon VPCs at the same time.

#### Transit Gateway (TGW)
A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. 
- Attachments — You can attach the following:
	- One or more VPCs
	- A Connect SD-WAN/third-party network appliance
	- An AWS Direct Connect gateway
	- A peering connection with another transit gateway
	- A VPN connection to a transit gateway
- Transit gateway Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) — A transit gateway supports an MTU of 8500 bytes for traffic between VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, Transit Gateway Connect, and peering attachments. Traffic over VPN connections can have an MTU of 1500 bytes.
- Transit gateway route table — A transit gateway has a default route table and can optionally have additional route tables.
- Associations — Each attachment is associated with exactly one route table. Each route table can be associated with zero to many attachments.
- Route propagation — A VPC, VPN connection, or Direct Connect gateway can dynamically propagate routes to a transit gateway route table. With a Connect attachment, the routes are propagated to a transit gateway route table by default. With a VPC, you must create static routes to send traffic to the transit gateway. With a VPN connection or a Direct Connect gateway, routes are propagated from the transit gateway to your on-premises router using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). With a peering attachment, you must create a static route in the transit gateway route table to point to the peering attachment.
