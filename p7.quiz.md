7. In Your company is hosting an application in AWS. The application is read intensive and consists of a set of web servers and AWS RDS. It has been noticed that the response time of the application increases due to the load on the AWS RDS instance. Which of the following measures can be taken to scale the data tier? (Choose TWO correct answers)
	Create Amazon DB Read Replicas. Configure the application layer to query the ReadReplicas for query needs.
	Use ElastiCache in front of your Amazon RDS DB to cache common queries.

8. Your organization is building a collaboration platform for which they chose AWS EC2 for web and application servers and MySQL RDS instance as the database. Due to the nature of the traffic to the application, they would like to increase the number of connections to RDS instance. How can this be achieved?
	Create a new parameter group, attach it to DB instance and change the setting.

9. You have an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database hosted in the Singapore region. You need to ensure that a backup database is in place and the data is asynchronously copied. Which of the following would help fulfill this requirement?
	Enable Read Replicas for the database

10. An application currently consists of an EC2 Instance hosting a Web application. The Web application connects to an AWS RDS database. Which of the following can be used to ensure that the database layer is highly available?
	Enable Multi-AZ for the AWS RDS database.

11. You are performing a Load Testing exercise on your application hosted on AWS. While testing your Amazon RDS MySQL DB Instance, you notice that your application becomes non responsive when you reach 100% CPU utilization. Your application is read-heavy. What methods will help scale your data-tier to meet the applicationâ€™s needs? (Choose THREE answers from the options given below).
	Add Amazon RDS DB Read Replicas, and have your application direct read queries to them.
	Share your data set among multiple Amazon RDS DB Instances.
	Use ElastiCache in front of your Amazon RDS DB to cache common queries.

12. Which of these features are provided by Amazon Aurora that are not available with other database engines? (Choose THREE corrects points).
	Aurora DB engine provides a higher throughput for lower cost than MySQL and PostgreSQL engines
	An Aurora DB cluster support autoscaling by increasing the number of replicas in the cluster
	Aurora MySQL the only engine supporting active-active/multi-master clustering

13. Your organization is developing a media sharing platform. What storage would fit best if main requirements are security (data must be encrypted at rest), scalability and minimal latency?
	AWS DynamoDB with DAX

14. Which of the following statements correctly describe a NoSQL database? (Choose THREE correct points)
