2. Do you need to pre-warm EBS volume restored/created from snapshots before use it on production?
	Yes, you do. You need to pre-worm by reading all blocks that have data (initialize) to reach maximum performance
No, you don't. It's ready to be used from the very beginning.

3. Can you modify EBS Volume on the fly (without detaching it): increase volume size, change volume type, or adjust I/O performance (for io1 disk)?

Data is stored in volumes and blocks where files are split into evenly-sized blocks. Each block has its own address and metadata
The data can be accessed directly through APIs or http/https
	Data is stored in volumes and blocks where files are split into evenly-sized blocks. Each block has its own address and don't have metadata
Access to data is constrained by a single path to the data
In block storage, data is stored in files, the files are organized in folders, and the folders are organized under a hierarchy of directories and subdirectories
	Block storage offers greater storage efficiency and faster performance than file storage
In block storage there is no folders, directories, or complex hierarchies, instead each object is a simple, self-contained repository that includes the data, metadata (descriptive information associated with an object), and a unique identifying ID number

	EFS is available for EC2 instances within multiple AZ
Compatible with Linux and Windows
	EFS automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files
	Security groups should be used to control NFS traffic
	EFS is more expensive then EBS
You need to choose the capacity plan before provisioning storage

EFS Intelligent-Tiering
EFS Regional-IA

17. You have a small database on EC2 instance with 200Gb EBS volume attached to it and find out that only 25% capacity of the volume is used. You decided to decrease disk size up to 100Gb. How can you achieve this goal?
Use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes
From the AWS console select the volume you want to change size. For Actions, choose Modify Volume and in the Size field enter a new size of the volume
	You can't straightforward decrease the size of EBS volume. All you can do is create a new smaller volume
Ask AWS Support to decrease the volume size

It’s a simple storage service that offers industry leading durability, availability, performance, security, and virtually unlimited scalability at very low costs. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5Gb. Max object size is 5Tb.
